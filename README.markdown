# BLOGSTER :pill: :fire:

***An open source content management system written in Python and Django.*** :pill: :fire:

## ABOUT :books:

I've been writing a lot lately and wanted to make an open source content management system in Django just for fun! This is that CMS. :) You can write your blog here once you have deployed this web app to a server. A list of features is below.

## FEATURES :test_tube:

- Django for Python 3.x

## USAGE :hammer:

### Simple usage

Login with your superuser credentials using the url of your app with the adage of `god`. Click on `posts` and make a new one.
Save it, logout, and go back to the home page. Voil√°! There is your post!

### Advanced usage

This CMS is meant to be customized. So to make this easier for you, I created a site-wide variable in `blogster/settings.py` called `SITE_VARS`. `SITE_VARS` has the following values and settings for you to customize. The flag `[third-party]` means that you will have to fetch this resource from a remote server, a link is required. `[SEO]` means that this resource is essential for search-engine-optimization. `[Social Media]` means that this resource is required for your site to look good on social media.

- `site_name`: The name of your site.
- `site_pic`: The avatar you would like to use for your site.
- `site_css`: The styles you want to use for your site. [third-party] If you change this, you might have to edit the templates located in `templates/posts` accordingly.
- `site_social_banner`: The banner the links to your site will display on social media.[third-party]
